I just want to make a mailmarketing tool to prove to myself that every other mail marketing tool on the market is just too expensive.
I will implement the following features:

- [ ] Oauth
- [ ] Guest User, a way to test the tool without the effort of an accountm just one click away of testing the framework
- [ ] Mail builder
- [ ] Mail tracking, views, clicks
- [ ] Contact DB Manager interface
- [ ] Campaigns
- [ ] Campaigns email flows, like send second email to people that view the first email
- [ ] Schedule email/campaigns
- [ ] Unsubscribe
- [ ] Payments

  - [ ] MbWay
- [ ] Invoices
- [ ] Graphical metrics analytics
- [ ] API
